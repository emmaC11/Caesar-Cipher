# Design
This websites design follows a minimalistic approach for a more professional look. I took inspiration from simplistic websites such as the Apple Store. It is an intuitive, easily navigable website with a bright colour scheme that aims for an elegant, simplistic look. 
## Colour Scheme
This website uses a purple colour palette. The primary colours used throughout the website are dark purple (#7f39fb), violet (#be83f1), pink (#e680c7) & grey (#a6a6a6;). I chose a bright colour scheme to make the design unique and to catch the users attention. 

## Typography
The headers throughout the website are using the <strong>Roboto</strong> font with letter spacing of 4px. The rest of the website also uses the <strong>Roboto</strong>.

## Wireframes
The wireframes were created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
